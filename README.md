# Quizzical

This project truly proved to be quite difficult to me as it was more 
complex than my last react projects. I really was able to get hands on 
practice with the following:

        -Utilizing React.useEffect() to only fetch API data according
        to the dependency that I set up.
        -Setting React.useState() to booleans, values, and objects.
